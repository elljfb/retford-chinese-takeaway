There is Ordsall, Thrumpton, Hallcort, Spital Hill, West Field and Newtown. Some are larger than others and house prices can vary in each location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hallcroft<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hallcroft is the most northerly part of Retford and encompasses a large area spreading from the edge of the town centre to the the top of North Road leading out of Retford.

Ordsall is classed as a village in it\u2019s own right but was made an official part of Retford.
