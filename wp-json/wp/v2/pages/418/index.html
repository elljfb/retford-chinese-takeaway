Cut the boneless, skinless chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces. Pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside while you prepare the batter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Create the Batter<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2.1. In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Mix well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.2. Create a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the beaten eggs. Gradually add cold water while stirring continuously to form a smooth batter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Coat and Fry the Chicken<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>3.1. Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large, deep pan to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.2. Dip each piece of seasoned chicken into the batter, ensuring it&#8217;s thoroughly coated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.3. Carefully drop the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, frying until they achieve a golden-brown crispiness. Remove and place on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Prepare the Sweet and Sour Sauce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>4.1. In a saucepan, combine pineapple juice, white vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, and soy sauce. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.2. In a small bowl, dissolve cornstarch in water to create a smooth slurry. Gradually whisk the slurry into the simmering sauce until it thickens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 5: Combine Chicken and Sauce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5.1. Toss the fried chicken balls into the sweet and sour sauce, ensuring they are evenly coated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.2. For an extra burst of flavour and texture, add pineapple chunks, diced bell peppers, and onions to the mix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 6: Serve and Enjoy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>6.1. Plate your sweet and sour fried chicken balls, garnishing with additional pineapple chunks and diced spring onions if desired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.2. Pair with steamed rice or noodles for a complete and satisfying meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1: Can I use chicken breast instead of thighs for this recipe?<\/strong> <em>A1:<\/em> Absolutely! While thighs provide a juicier result, chicken breast works well too. Just ensure not to overcook it to maintain tenderness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2: Can I make the sweet and sour sauce in advance?<\/strong> <em>A2:<\/em> Certainly! Prepare the sauce ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator. Reheat gently before tossing with the fried chicken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3: Can I use a different type of oil for frying?<\/strong> <em>A3:<\/em> Yes, you can use vegetable oil, peanut oil, or any oil with a high smoke point suitable for deep frying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4: What is the best way to store leftovers?<\/strong> <em>A4:<\/em> Store any leftover sweet and sour fried chicken balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Reheat in the oven for best results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q5: Can I make this dish gluten-free?<\/strong> <em>A5:<\/em> Indeed!
