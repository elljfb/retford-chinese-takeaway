Soak the chips in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove excess starch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>1.2. <strong>Dry Thoroughly:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>After soaking, pat the chips completely dry with a clean kitchen towel. Ensuring they are dry is crucial for achieving that perfect crispy texture.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Fry to Perfection<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2.1. <strong>Heat the Oil:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In a deep fryer or large, deep pan, heat the vegetable oil to around 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F). Ensure there&#8217;s enough oil for the chips to be fully submerged.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2.2. <strong>Fry in Batches:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Carefully lower batches of the dried chips into the hot oil. Fry until they are golden brown and crisp, then remove and drain on paper towels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Spice Infusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>3.1. <strong>Prepare the Spice Mix:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In a bowl, combine salt, black pepper, Chinese five-spice powder, garlic powder, and onion powder. Adjust the quantities to suit your taste preferences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>3.2. <strong>Toss in Spice Mix:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>While the chips are still hot, toss them in the spice mix, ensuring an even coating. The residual heat will help the spices adhere to the chips.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Add Fresh Elements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>4.1. <strong>Green Chillies:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Slice the fresh green chillies and scatter them over the seasoned chips. Adjust the quantity based on your spice tolerance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>4.2. <strong>Spring Onions:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sprinkle sliced spring onions over the chips for a burst of freshness and a mild onion flavour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 5: Garnish and Serve<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5.1. <strong>Coriander Finale:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>For an optional touch of freshness, garnish the chips with chopped fresh coriander.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>5.2. <strong>Serve Hot:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plate your homemade salt and pepper chips and serve immediately while they&#8217;re at their crispiest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1: Can I use a different type of potato?<\/strong> <em>A1:<\/em> While Maris Piper potatoes are ideal for their starch content, you can experiment with other varieties like King Edward or Russet for slightly different textures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2: Can I oven-bake the chips instead of frying?<\/strong> <em>A2:<\/em> Although frying provides the crispiest results, you can bake the chips in a preheated oven at 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F) for a healthier alternative. Coat them in a bit of oil for best results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3: What&#8217;s the key to achieving extra crispy chips?<\/strong> <em>A3:<\/em> Ensure the potatoes are thoroughly dried before frying, and fry them in batches to prevent overcrowding. The oil should be hot enough to create that irresistible crispiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4: Can I make these chips in advance?<\/strong> <em>A4:<\/em> While they are best enjoyed fresh, you can partially fry the chips and then finish frying just before serving to maintain their crispiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q5: Can I make a larger batch of the spice mix for future use?<\/strong> <em>A5:<\/em> Absolutely! Mix larger quantities of the spice blend, store it in an airtight container, and use it whenever the craving for salt and pepper chips strikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations!
