This helps the rub and smoke penetrate the meat for maximum flavour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>1.2. <strong>Trim Excess Fat:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trim any excess fat from the ribs, leaving a thin layer for added flavour and moisture.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Apply the Rub<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2.1. <strong>Create the Rub:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In a bowl, combine brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper to form the dry rub.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2.2. <strong>Massage the Ribs:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Massage the dry rub generously onto both sides of the ribs, ensuring an even coating. Let the ribs marinate in the rub for at least 1 hour, or preferably, overnight for intensified flavour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Prepare the BBQ Sauce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>3.1. <strong>Mix the Ingredients:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, and your favourite BBQ sauce. This will be the luscious glaze for your ribs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Fire up the Grill or Preheat the Oven<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>4.1. <strong>Grilling Option:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If using a grill, preheat it to medium heat (around 180-200\u00b0C or 350-400\u00b0F). Ensure there&#8217;s an indirect heat zone for slow cooking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>4.2. <strong>Oven Option:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If using an oven, preheat it to 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F). You can use the broil function for a final crisp at the end.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 5: Slow Cook the Ribs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5.1. <strong>Grill Method:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Place the ribs on the grill, bone side down, over indirect heat. Cover and cook for approximately 2 to 2.5 hours, occasionally basting with the BBQ sauce during the last 30 minutes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>5.2. <strong>Oven Method:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If using the oven, place the ribs on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Bake for 2 to 2.5 hours, basting with BBQ sauce in the final 30 minutes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 6: Achieve the Perfect Glaze<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>6.1. <strong>Baste and Sear:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Increase the grill or oven temperature to around 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F). Baste the ribs with a final layer of BBQ sauce and sear for an additional 10-15 minutes until a beautiful glaze forms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 7: Rest and Serve<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>7.1. <strong>Rest the Ribs:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Let the ribs rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring moist and flavourful meat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>7.2. <strong>Serve with Flair:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Slice the ribs between the bones, serve on a platter, and revel in the barbecue masterpiece you&#8217;ve just created.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1: Can I use a different cut of pork for this recipe?<\/strong> <em>A1:<\/em> While spare ribs are classic, you can use baby back ribs for a leaner option. Adjust cooking times accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2: Is it necessary to marinate the ribs overnight?<\/strong> <em>A2:<\/em> While it enhances flavour, a minimum of 1 hour marination is sufficient. Overnight marination, however, intensifies the taste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3: Can I use a store-bought BBQ sauce?<\/strong> <em>A3:<\/em> Absolutely! Pick your favourite brand or flavour to personalise the dish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4: How do I know when the ribs are done?<\/strong> <em>A4:<\/em> The meat should easily pull away from the bones, and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read around 93\u00b0C (200\u00b0F).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q5: Can I freeze leftover cooked ribs?<\/strong> <em>A5:<\/em> Yes, you can freeze cooked ribs. Wrap them tightly in foil or plastic wrap and place them in a sealed container.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations!
